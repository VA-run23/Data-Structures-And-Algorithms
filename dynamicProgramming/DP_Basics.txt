/* Optimal substructure
Optimal substructure is a property of a problem 
that allows it to be broken down into smaller subproblems, 
which can be solved independently. The overall optimal solution 
can then be constructed from these optimal subproblem solutions. 
This property is essential for the application of dynamic programming.
*/


/* Memoization
Memoization is a technique used to store the results of expensive function calls 
and reuse them when the same inputs occur again. This helps to avoid redundant 
computations and improve the efficiency of algorithms. It's particularly useful 
in dynamic programming to handle overlapping subproblems by saving their results 
for future use.
*/


/*  Iterative 
The dynamic programming approach combines the iterative method with memoization 
to store the results of subproblems. This approach prevents redundant computations 
and ensures optimal performance by building up the solution iteratively 
while using a table to store intermediate results.
*/


// Recursive Approach (without memoization):
/*
The recursive approach breaks the problem into smaller subproblems but often 
results in redundant computations due to lack of memoization, leading to inefficiency.
*/

// Iterative Approach (using loops):
/*
The iterative approach uses loops instead of recursion to solve the problem,
avoiding recursive function call overhead and making the code more efficient 
and easier to understand for problems like computing the Fibonacci sequence.

void* memset(void* ptr, int value, size_t num);

ptr: Pointer to the block of memory to fill.
value: The value to be set. This value is passed as an int, but the function fills the memory block with its unsigned char conversion.
num: Number of bytes to be set to the value.
