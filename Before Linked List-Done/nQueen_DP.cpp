/*
1. Start in the leftmost column.
2. Place a queen in the current column and move to the next column.
3. Check if placing the queen in the current row is safe. If it is:
   - Place the queen and move to the next column.
   - If placing the queen in the current row is not safe, move it to the next row within the same column and check again.
4. If all queens are placed safely, return true.
5. If placing a queen leads to a solution, recursively place queens in the remaining columns.
6. If placing a queen in a column does not lead to a solution, remove the queen (backtrack) and try the next row.
7. If all rows and columns have been tried and no solution is found, return false.

/*
To compare the efficiency of O(n^n) and O(n^2 * 2^n):

O(n^n):
This represents exponential growth where the base is n and the exponent is also n. The complexity grows extremely fast, making it impractical for large n.

O(n^2 * 2^n):
This also represents exponential growth but with a smaller base of 2 and an additional polynomial factor of n^2. While it still grows quickly, the growth rate is less aggressive compared to O(n^n).

Comparison
- For small values of n: Both complexities are manageable, but O(n^2 * 2^n) will typically perform better.
- For large values of n: O(n^n) grows exponentially much faster and becomes infeasible much sooner compared to O(n^2 * 2^n).

 Conclusion
O(n^2 * 2^n) is more efficient than O(n^n) for both small and large values of n.
In practical terms, for large problems, even O(n^2 * 2^n) can be too slow, but it is significantly better than O(n^n).
