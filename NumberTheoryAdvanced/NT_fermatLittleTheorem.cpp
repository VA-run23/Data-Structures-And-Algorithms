//Fermat's little theorem states that:
//If p is a prime number then for any integer a, the number a^(p)-a is an integer multiple of p


/*
 * Fermat's Little Theorem states that if p is a prime number and a is an integer not divisible by p, then:
 * a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p)
 *
 * In simpler terms, this means that a^(p-1) - 1 is an integer multiple of p.
 *
 * Example:
 * If p = 7 and a = 3:
 * 3^6 ≡ 1 (mod 7)
 * which means 3^6 - 1 is divisible by 7. Indeed, 3^6 = 729 and 729 - 1 = 728, which is divisible by 7.
