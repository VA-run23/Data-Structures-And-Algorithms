//Reason    
//Nodes 0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 are isolated and not connected in this specific input, so they don't appear in this visual representation


//NOTE THIS
// is this input correct: 
// 4 3 //4 nodes and 3 edges
// 7 8
// 8 3 
// 3 5
// No, the input is not correct. The first value, 4, indicates that there are 4 nodes, but the edges provided (7 8, 8 3, 3 5) involve nodes numbered 7 and above. This conflicts with the number of nodes specified.

// Correct Input Structure:
// The number of nodes (n) should be greater than or equal to the highest numbered node in your edge list.

// The edges should involve nodes within the specified range of n.

// Corrected Example:
// If you want to include nodes 7, 8, 3, and 5, the number of nodes (n) should be at least 9 to accommodate the highest node number, 8:

// 9 3
// 7 8
